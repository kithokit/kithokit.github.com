I found that when we work on Octopress with Github Pages
after I make a new post and run `rake deploy`
It doesn't take effect immediately.
Actaully we need to wait for a while for `new post` or `new delete post` or `_config.yml`
However, for editing a current file, it will take the effect automatically.

We need to beware of that.
